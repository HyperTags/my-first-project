# My First Project

This is a project to help me learn version control with Git and GitHub.

## Goals
- Learn the basic Git workflow.
- Understand how to use GitHub.
- Become a version control pro!


# Create and switch to a new branch called "new-feature"
git checkout -b new-feature
# Make a change, add, and commit it.
git add .
git commit -m "Add a cool new feature"
# Push the new branch to GitHub
git push -u origin new-feature
